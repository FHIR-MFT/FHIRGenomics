## Actors and Transactions

| Actor                | Definition                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Order Placer         | Commonly known as the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) System                                                                                     |
| Order Filler         | Genomic Laboratory Hub (GLH), Laboratory Information System (LIMS)                                                                               |
| Automation Manager   | This is the function of [Genomic Order Management Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/genomic-order-management-service-fhir) |
| Order Result Tracker | This is the function of [Genomic Order Management Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/genomic-order-management-service-fhir) |

Initially only the IHE `LAB-1` is in focus and this is probably using HL7 v2.x ORM_O01/OML_O21 as described below.
This will be followed by IHE `LAB-3` probably using HL7 v2.x ORU_R01
Later stages will include the use of [Genomic Order Management Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/genomic-order-management-service-fhir), using HL7 FHIR which will add in concepts covered in `LAB-4`.

## Cross Profile Considerations

It is recommended that the actors receive patient demographic and encounter updates only within the
context of a work order. Whenever patient data changes, due to:

- Update patient information (A31 or A08)
- Patient transfer (A02)
- Transfer cancelled (A12)
â€¢ Patients merge (A40)

Note: Event trigger definitions based on [NHS England HL7 v2 ADT Message Specification](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FRkyZvWpZB1nCKbvQbo-eW_q9VtlR3Ws) which is NHS England's supplement to IHE Technical Framework Volume2: [Patient Identity Management [ITI-30]](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ITI-30.html) and  [Patient Encounter Management [ITI-31]](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ITI-31.html).
